📊 Linear Regression on Ecommerce Customer Data
This project is a personal implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict customer spending based on their activity and usage patterns on an ecommerce website. The project is inspired by foundational tutorials but built independently to strengthen my understanding of data analysis and machine learning workflows.

🎯 Objective
To predict the Yearly Amount Spent by ecommerce customers using features like:

Time spent on the website and app

Length of membership

Session behavior

🗂 Dataset Summary
The dataset includes user-level data such as:

Average Session Length

Time on App

Time on Website

Length of Membership

Yearly Amount Spent (target variable)

🧠 Process
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations

Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Evaluated the model using common regression metrics (R², MAE, RMSE)

Interpreted results to understand the most impactful features

🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

🔍 Key Takeaways
Features like Length of Membership and Time on App were strong predictors of customer spending.

The project helped reinforce core ML concepts like data preparation, model evaluation, and regression interpretation.
